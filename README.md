# Test Creator

This website allows teachers to create multiple choice tests for their students to take. The teacher can set a time limit on the test and the test will automatically be submitted once the time limit is reached if the student has not yet submitted the test. The teacher can also view all of the results from their students on a single page. There is a separate log in for teachers and students. The teacher must provide the student with the test ID and teacher ID in order for the student to take the test.

This project was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Firebase for the database functionality.
