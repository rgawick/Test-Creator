This website allows teachers to create multiple choice tests for their students to take. Teachers can set a time limit for the test and once the students have taken the test, the teacher can go to a different page to view the results. There is a separate log in for teachers and students. The teacher must provide the student with the test ID and teacher ID in order for the student to take the test.

This project was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Firebase for the database functionality.
